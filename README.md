**Feature Extraction**: The VGG16 model is employed to extract rich and informative features from two input images.

**Distance Metrics:** The Euclidean distance metric is used to measure the dissimilarity between the extracted feature vectors, providing insight into the spatial separation of features.



**Similarity Metrics:** The cosine similarity metric is employed to gauge the similarity between the extracted feature vectors, revealing the degree of alignment between feature directions.
